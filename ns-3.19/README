A simple LTE experiment setup:
============================

1. Overview:
This is a simple LTE experiment with UE(s) and 1 eNodeB. The Radio Access Network (RAN) includes error model, propagation model. 
The RAN does not include mobility, fading, random UEs allocation.

2. Package Structure:
    - ns-3.19: root directory.
    - lte-non-nsc.in/lte-non-nsc.out: input/output configuration files.
    - run-lte.sh: run an experiment and plot figures, results are in "results" foler.
    - ns-3.19/scratch/lte-non-nsc.cc: experiment script.
    - ns-3.19/results: parsing scripts and plotting scripts.
        = /parser: parsing.sh - parses TCP.log file for Congestion Window value, etc.
        = /fig: plotted figures locate here.
        = /data: data files for plotting (outputs of ./parsing.sh).
        = TCP.log/UDP.log: log files from the running experiment.
